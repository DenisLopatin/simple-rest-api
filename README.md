### Getting start

You should create a database and a configuration file simply 
by filling in the data in `.env`. Your `.env` file should look
like this:

    DB_DRIVER=""
    DB_HOST=""
    DB_NAME=""
    DB_USER="root"
    DB_PASSWORD=""
    DB_PORT=""
    DB_CHARSET=""

You can use migration API to get all tables: `users`, `todos`,
`posts` and `comments`.
